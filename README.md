## What it is

c101 is a complete Claude Code configuration (agents, skills, saved workflows, hooks, MCP servers and Python
tooling) that turns a single session into a coordinated team:

- **Orchestration.** A main-thread `delegator` routes every request to the cheapest adequate route: a single expert,
  an `orchestrator` running a plan DAG, a swarm over shards, a subagent mesh on a shared blackboard, an ensemble of
  experts, or a `mediator` where several agents solve the same problem independently and **vote** (Schulze, Borda,
  approval, plurality, logarithmic opinion pool).
- **57 agents in eight groups** (orchestration, planning, quality, research, experts, synthesis, image, meta), each
  with a model tier, an effort level, a step budget, only the MCP servers it calls (connected only while it runs), and at most three role skills on
  top of the three protocol skills every agent preloads.
- **Depth 8, bounded.** Native nested subagents are raised from 3 to 8 levels. The `pre-agent` hook gives every child
  a `<stack-context>` header (depth, parent, remaining depth, spawn count, token budget, output directory) and
  enforces per-caller spawn rules, a 128-spawn session budget and whole-tree token budgets (session 2.5B guaranteed,
  7.5B soft, 10B hard; per prompt 100M, 300M, 400M).
- **Three model tiers.** `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5` and `claude-haiku-5-5` are the only models allowed
  anywhere, enforced at seven layers; a caller that wants cheaper or stronger work picks a different agent, never a
  per-call model or effort.
- **Planning and quality.** Planners, an architect, a plan critic, reviewers with adversarial verification,
  validators, testers, quality control, code-quality analysis, optimisation, security and debugging; nothing reaches
  the user without a gate.
- **Research.** Quick and deep researchers, web search (Exa, Jina), scraping and crawling (Spider), real browsing
  (Playwright), computer use (the user's own macOS apps interactively, or a disposable, network-less desktop
  container that also runs under the Agent SDK), papers (arXiv/SSRN), fact checking, and summarizers, including a `file-summarizer`
  that keeps full output on disk and returns a compact digest.
- **Experts and synthesis.** Computer graphics, computer science, quantum computing, Rust, C++, Go, Haskell, Julia,
  Java, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, mathematics, physics and graphic design, each backed by a hub skill and granular skills, plus
  synthesis agents that combine experts into higher-level answers (Delphi panels, debate, analogy, first principles).
- **Saved workflows.** Eight deterministic JavaScript workflows (`/swarm-run`, `/fanout`, `/mediate`,
  `/expert-panel`, `/research-sweep`, `/review-verify`, `/plan-tournament`, `/visual-iterate`): agents produce the
  content, and the script computes every decision (tallies, quantiles, stop rules, dedup, coverage ledgers).
- **Context first.** Output past ~60 lines goes to `.stack/out/<agent>/` and only a summary and a path travel up;
  every reply follows a five-section output contract; uncertain facts are verified or escalated as Open doubts, never
  guessed. The stack optimises for context usage, not speed.
- **Images and vectors.** One MCP server with a tool per operation (generation, references, edits, transparency,
  segmentation, background removal, upscaling, SVG generation, tracing), each pointed at your own endpoint and model
  with no fallbacks, layered SVG and layered PDF output, and a `visual-reviewer` that scores every result against the
  brief until it passes.
- **Bayesian self-tuning.** After each session the learner updates per-agent posteriors (censored log-normal tool
  rounds, Dirichlet effort bands, Beta failure rate, token windows) and moves `maxTurns`, effort and context windows
  within bounds at the next session start (never mid-session), as audited edits to the agent files; `bin/stack learn
  history` shows the per-agent trends.
- **Two runtimes, one definition.** Everything runs interactively (`bin/claude-stack`) and programmatically through
  the Claude Agent SDK (`bin/stack-sdk`); secrets live only in `~/.claude/stack.env`.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> c101 && cd c101
./install.sh                    # uv installs Python 3.13 + deps; creates ~/.claude/stack.env (mode 600)
$EDITOR ~/.claude/stack.env     # add your keys and image endpoints (see below)
bin/stack keys                  # which keys are set (names only)
bin/stack doctor                # validates agents, skills, workflows, MCP, hooks, tiers, packs
bin/claude-stack                # Claude Code with the delegator as the main thread
```

Inside Claude Code, accept the folder trust dialog once: each agent defines its MCP servers inline, and Claude Code
connects them only in a trusted folder, only while that agent runs. Run `/mcp` once to enable computer use on the
host desktop; for sandboxed computer use install Docker or podman and run `bin/desktop-sandbox --build` once.

Use the stack in every project, with only the packs you want:

```bash
./install.sh --user --packs rust,quantum,graphic-design   # core is always included
./install.sh --enforce-models                               # restrict every project to the tier models (alone or with --user)
./install.sh --main-agent                                   # make the delegator the default main thread
```

Requirements: macOS or Linux, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 18+ (for the Playwright MCP server),
Claude Code 2.1.29x or later.
